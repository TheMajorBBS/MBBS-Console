# MBBS-console

A new Flutter project. This web console will allow you to see stats for<br>
The Major BBS system.  We use a websocket to mark the console as closely to the<br>
original as possible

## Getting Started

This project is built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.<br>
This project can be comiled for web, win64, mac64 or linux including ARM64<br>


You should use the Sysop account to login, default prot is 8881 and can not be changed<br>
as of yet.  All versions can be hosted external from the system since it is using a websocket.<br>

Current builds are int he releases folder for Windows64bit and Web.
